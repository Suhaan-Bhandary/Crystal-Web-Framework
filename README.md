# Server in C++

```
C++ Web Application Framework created from scratch. Inspired by Express and Django.
```

## [Home Page](https://crystal-web-framework.onrender.com)

## Motivation

In the beginning, it was a simple HTTP server built using sockets in C++, but it evolved into a flexible and minimal framework for building web applications.

My C++, DSA, and Networking skills were honed by developing this project and I gained a deep understanding of how servers operate.

## Features

- Dynamic Router
- URL Path Params and Query String Support
- Response Status Codes
- JSON Parser and Creator
- JSON Body Support in Requests and Responses
- Cookies Support
- Automatic Public File Indexing and Parsing
- Routing and Controller Structure Similar to Express
- Request Redirect
- HTML Page Support
- Static Fields
- ETags for Client Side Caching
- Monitor for Live Restart [./monitor/DOCUMENTATION.md](./monitor/DOCUMENTATION.md)

### Note

Currently, this project only runs on Linux, but I plan to add support for Windows and Mac in the future.

## Run Locally

### Dependencies

- Linux Operating System
- C++ Compiler
- cmake
- Git

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Suhaan-Bhandary/Crystal-Web-Framework
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Crystal-Web-Framework
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
  sudo ./ubuntu_setup.sh # select option 1 for install
```

Compile the Server

```bash
  rm -rf ./build
  ./scripts/debug_configure.sh
  ./scripts/build.sh
```

Run the Server

```bash
  ./scripts/run_example.sh
```

You will see the below output after running

```bash
Listening on Address: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8080
```

## Running with Live Restart

To use live restart functionality use the monitor bash script.
Before running the monitor file uncomment the `#CUSTOM_MACROS = -DDEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT` in the Makefile

```bash
  ./monitor/monitor.sh
```

## Running on Docker

To run the server on Docker

```bash
  docker build -t http-server-cpp .
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -t http-server-cpp
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  rm -rf ./build
  ./scripts/debug_configure.sh
  ./scripts/build.sh
  ./scripts/run_test.sh
```

## Usage/Examples

To Create a Web Application user can edit the app/ folder in the project.

#### User Folders

- app/Router: Define the routes of the Web Application.
- app/Controller: Stores the controllers for each route.
- app/public: Store all the files which are to be made public to the internet.
- app/templates: It is used to store all the html template.
